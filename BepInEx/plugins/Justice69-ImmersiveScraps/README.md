## Introduction :

Adds a bunch of new immersive scraps. The goal of this mod is to add more lore-friendly scraps to the game.

All the assets from this mod are made by me or come from free 3D assets website https://www.sketchfab.com (links below)

I reworked every textures to match the grungy art style of Lethal Company, so the scraps wouldn't feel too clean.

I also heavily optimized each piece. This mod is a good friend for slow computers. Textures never exceed 512px (unlike your typical scrap mod who bullies your GPU with 2k textures for no reason). 

Number of tris per assets is very low and optimized (never exceed 2000 tris // average = 500 tris).

This means that your computer won't catch fire because of this mod.

New scraps can have randomized textures and models. For more variety, they come in multiple colors.

Immersive, lore-friendly, light and optimized new scraps.

New tools and weapons can be found in the game (fireaxe, baseball bat, etc...) Some deal 2 damages but they're very rare.
