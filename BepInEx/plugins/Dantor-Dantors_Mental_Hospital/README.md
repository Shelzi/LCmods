# Dantor's Mental Hospital

## Description:
Adds a new custom interior themed as a psyquiatric institution to explore and get lost. The map features a wide variety of rooms and corridors, dynamic props and variations while trying to keep it balanced

This is my first ever mod so bear with me

**Features:**
- Currently 13 different tiles (More planned)
- Long corridors with covers to protect yourself from Nutcrackers & Thumpers
- Big terminal doors
- Randomized prop spawns to help making every tile feel different
- Dynamic Fire Exit spawns
- Jump tiles
- Moving obstacles

**Planned:**
- Apparatus room tile
- More rooms
- Improved prop randomization
- (Maybe) more themes
