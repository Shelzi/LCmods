# Dantor's Mental Hospital

## Description:
Adds a new custom interior themed as a psyquiatric institution to explore and get lost. The map features a wide variety of rooms and corridors, dynamic props and variations while trying to keep it balanced to fit the vanilla's experience.
This is my first ever mod so bear with me.

**Features:**
- Currently 13 different tiles (More planned)
- 3 different main entrance variations to spice things up
- 3 different jump room layouts (with moving obstacles!)
- Green colored steam fog (optional) which can also damage players if they stay for too long (optional)
- Breaker box spawns
- Big terminal doors
- Long corridors with covers to protect yourself from Nutcrackers & Thumpers
- Randomized prop spawns to help making every tile feel different
- Dynamic Fire Exit spawns


**Planned:**
- Apparatus room tile
- More rooms
- Improved prop randomization
- (Maybe) more themes
