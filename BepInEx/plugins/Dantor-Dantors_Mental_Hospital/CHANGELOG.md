## 1.2.1
- Tweaked Fire Exit chances to prevent them not spawning sometimes (hopefully)
- Removed a fix that could be causing issues when other mods modify the scrap amount generated (needs more testing)

## 1.2.0
- Introduced 2 new variations to the main entrance (there is now a total of 3!)

- Added new options at the Mental Hospital config to personalize the dungeon size and the steam valve's fog
- Renamed the dungeon from "HospitalFlow" to "Mental Hospital" at the terminal and LLL config. It is recommended to erase the old entry at LLL's config
- Removed turrets from the jump room
- Tweaked some prop spawns
- Spray now works at the reception door and some corners (oops)
- Fixed an issue with a few gaps at the main entrance

## 1.1.1

- Made overall map slighly darker
- Final pass on props LODs
- Scrap should not appear inside/below any prop anymore

## 1.0.4
**Performance:** 
- Reduced most textures from 1024 to 512 
- Removed double sided walls/floors/ceilings to avoid rendering unnecessary object 
- Removed some high poly count LODs on props 
- Drastically reduced whole assetbundle size

**Gameplay**
- Reduced map size even further, and made it sightly dynamic to each moon. Average size is now close to x1 max It should be way easier to find scrap even on easy moons 
- Fire Exits should appear further from the main entrance more often now 

**Other**
- Updated README to include a Donation button

## 1.0.3
- **Drastically reduced dungeon sized and locked it between x1 and x1.25 (Rend's size).** This change will help making loot less sparced and should feel better specially on Rend, Dine and Titan. Smaller moons may need more tweaking. 
- Potential fix to an issue with the Inverse Teleporter and LethalThing's traps which teleported played outside the interior bounds 
- Removed collision on doors while they are being open 
- Improved doors animation 
- Added a potential fix to cases on which scrap wasn't generating as it should 
- Removed deprecated config option. Consider deleting the config file so a new one gets generated on next game startup 

**Note: The dev (me) is going to be traveling until 21th so no more updates will come until he is back, please everyone behave well and don't break anything while I'm away**
