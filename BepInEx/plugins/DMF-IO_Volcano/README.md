This mod adds IO, Jupiter's volcanic moon to Lethal Company using free assets from both Unity and CgTrader

  
Installation

The moon should automatically install if using the mod manager.</br >
For manual installation, drag and drop the `BepInEx` folder into your LC root folder, or drag and drop `skytop.lem` directly into your `Modules` folder.</br >
Be sure you have all the required dependencies installed before downloading.</br >
All players in the lobby are required to have the mod for it to work.
