# LethalModManager Roadmap
<details open><summary>1.0.0 RELEASE (Mod Manager) - Within the month.</summary>
An entire mod manager within the game.

- Pending Join Requests
- Final touches to UIs.
- More security checks.
- Thunderstore mod listings in-game.
- A lot more settings to change in-game.
- Save-slot mod listings so you know what mods to play with per save.
</details>
<details><summary>0.1.0 BETA (Mod Syncer) - Within a week or two.</summary>
Syncs up your mods with the host (if they have the mod) of their lobby.

- Indicator for lobbies that have a host with the mod.
- Some sort of basic lobby compatibility list, but will only work for hosts that also have the mod, it will show the missing mods and extra mods you have. Will allow preventing people with missing/outdated/extra mods with in-game options, if I can get them done in time, if not, it will have to stay in the config.
- Show a more advanced mod list when joining the game, it will display likes, downloads, version, logo, description, and have an expanded section option for showing other things like READMEs/CHANGELOGs/Source. You will also be able to select which ones are downloaded and which ones should permanently save or just save to "cache" (which would delete after closing the game), or just not download at all.
- As the host, you will also have the ability to set mandatory/preferred/optional mods and/or configs to download when joining the lobby.
- Basic checks for malware, it won't be perfect, but we have the cleanup crew to help us.
- Allow profile codes with multiple settings for it as it is actually a security risk, funnily enough. (If you set it to download really anything, this allows for your friends' custom mods that isn't published, but either way, I wouldn't recommend it.)
- Allow quick reboots if you want to make sure everything is working completely fine. (This would honestly be heavily preferred, and I may touch up on it a lot more at full release to make it as smooth/seamless as possible.)

<details><summary><b>0.0.1 ALPHA (Mod List) - OUT NOW.</b></summary>
A simple mod list for now.
</details>

## 0.0.2
- Made it place the Mods button relative to the Host button and added a new setting in the config to help with its positional relativity to it.
