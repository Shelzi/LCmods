- Dragon Black

## Installation
- Install dependencies 
- Add contents to plugins folder so that the moresuits folder is next to MoreSuits.dll

## Features
- You can choose which variant to play the game in by changing into the corresponding suit on the suit rack. 
 
## Known Issues
- Physics can be laggy. 
- Might look odd in bad lighting.  
- Does not replace hands. You will only see the model in multiplayer lobbies or with a third person mod. 
- VERY scuffed and not perfect
- Some animations seem off due to the model having more bones in the rig that cause arms to seem longer.
